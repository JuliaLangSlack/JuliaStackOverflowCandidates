# Candidate questions that should be ported over to StackOverflow
Candidate questions that should be ported over to StackOverflow.

## Readme

This repo will provide the ability to keep track of questions that should be ported over to the StackOverflow under the [`Julia`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/julia?tab=Newest) tag. 

If you have a question you don't know the answer to or want to port over an already answered question, but don't have time, open an issue on this repo so someone else can do it! 

Thanks for helping improve the knowledge transfer in the Julia Commnity :) !
